                   <p>When it comes to love, we might all be Luddites. Wouldn’t we smash the machine that told us precisely where and when our former paramours found someone new? Unfortunately, the global index that contains every gossamer byte of the love letters we're always unwittingly writing as we make contact across the web is quite unsmashable. We are at a fundamental cultural tipping point in how we deal with love, courtship&mdashand inevitably, heartbreak. Is this the collapse of love as we know it? How do we renegotiate intimacy in the Internet age?</p>

      <p><a href="http://jessicahische.is" title="Jessica Hische">Jessica Hische</a> is a letterer, illustrator, and self-described &ldquo;avid internetter&rdquo;. After graduating with a degree in Graphic and Interactive Design from Tyler School of Art (Temple University) in 2006, she worked for Headcase Design in Philadelphia before taking a position as Senior Designer at Louise Fili Ltd. While working for Louise, she learned most of her skills as a letterer and spent upwards of 16 hours every day working (9 for Louise, 7+ for freelance clients). After two and a half years, Jessica left to further her freelance career and embark on several fun personal projects. Jessica began <a href="http://www.dailydropcap.com" title="Daily Drop Cap">Daily Drop Cap</a>, a project in which every day she created a new illustrative letter, working through the alphabet a total of twelve times. At its peak, the site had more than 100,000 visitors per month. It culminated with a thirteenth alphabet, each letter crafted by a guest contributor.</p>
      <p>Jessica has become as well known for her side projects as she has for her client work. While she doesn’t consider herself a web designer, many of her personal projects are web-centric. She’s created several educational micro-sites including <a href="http://www.momthisishowtwitterworks.com" title="Mom This is How Twitter Works">Mom This is How Twitter Works</a>, <a href="http://shouldiworkforfree.com" title="Should I Work for Free?">Should I Work for Free?</a> and <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com" title="Don’t Fear the Internet">Don’t Fear the Internet</a> (with Russ Maschmeyer), each as entertaining as they are helpful. She coined the term &ldquo;<a href="http://jessicahische.is/aprocrastiworker" title="Jessica Hische - Side Projects">procrastiworking</a>&rdquo; to describe her tendency to procrastinate on client work by working on personal projects.</p>
      <p>Jessica’s clients includes Wes Anderson, Tiffany &amp; Co., The New York Times, Penguin Books, Target, Leo Burnett, American Express, and Wired Magazine. She has also released several commercial typefaces which are available in <a href="http://jessicahische.is/sellingyoustuff" title="Jessica Hische - Shop">her store</a>. Jessica has been named a Print Magazine New Visual Artist (20 under 30), one of Forbes 30 under 30 in Art and Design, an ADC Young Gun, a &ldquo;Person to Watch&rdquo; by GD USA, and one of 25 Emerging Artists by STEP Magazine. She’s been personally profiled in many magazines including Eye Magazine (UK), Communication Arts, Grafik Magazine (UK), and Novum Magazine (Germany). She is currently serving on the <a href="http://tdc.org" title="The Type Directors Club | Promoting excellence in typography for over 65 years.">Type Directors Club</a> <a href="http://tdc.org/our-board/" title="About: Board of Directors | The Type Directors Club">Board of Directors</a> and divides her time fairly evenly between San Francisco, Brooklyn, and airports en route to design and illustration conferences.</p>

        <p>When we think about collapse, the narrative that comes to mind is that of the massive environmental challenges facing us as a species, as we attempt to recover from variously boiling, acid-bathing, and poisoning ourselves. Just as real, though, is the collapse of trust that's led us to be on such a direct collision path with the end of our future. We have placed a trust in our governments to act in our interests and in our institutions to think on the kind of timescales that lone individuals often fail to, but that trust has completely collapsed. The problem of ecological collapse in the large is really a failure of governance and timescale, an issue of state capture, a failure of fundamental ethics and vision on the part of the super-empowered, a systemic, emergent nightmare.</p>
        <p>Let's walk into that nightmare, sit with it for a while, and then see how we can walk back out.</p>

                   <p>Nirvan discovered a 9 year old kid named Caine who had made an arcade out of cardboard at an auto parts store. Nirvan bought a fun pass and his life was changed. He organized a flash mob to visit <a href="http://cainesarcade.com" title="Caine&#039;s Arcade  | A cardboard arcade made by a 9-year-old boy.">Caine's Arcade</a> on one day and changed Caine's life. Nirvan made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faIFNkdq96U" title="Caine&#39;s Arcade">short film about the whole experience</a>. And then both of their lives changed. They went from arcade to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul9c-4dX4Hk" title="Caine&#39;s Arcade 2: From a Movie to a Movement">movie to global movement</a> of kids making amazing things out of cardboard. From there, <a href="http://www.imagination.is" title="Imagination Foundation">The Imagination Foundation</a> launched, bringing creativity to classrooms and communities by unplugging for a day to play.</p>

        <p>Launching our big ideas into the world takes courage & moxy. We dive in, our eyes twinkling with possibility and hope, and if we’re lucky we catalyze collaborators, supportive fans, customers and a community along the way. But what happens when you’ve lost that loving feeling? Or when you realize it’s time to let go of the baby you’ve put your blood, sweat & tears into and move on? Letting go of what could have been may just take more courage & moxy than getting the idea off the ground in the first place.</p>
