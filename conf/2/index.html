                  Recently Tara wrote a popular post on Forbes about how LA is going to take over the Silicon Valley as the hottest place to run a tech startup. This post received both positive cheers from the LA startup community and guffaws from Silicon Valley. In her talk Tara will talk about the history of the LA tech scene and map out where the startups and money guys (VCs, incubators) are within LA County.

By 2006 she was coordinating the University of California Free and Anonymous HIV test program and setting her sights on lifetime pursuing social justice.</p>

      <p>After graduating from UC Santa Cruz she relocated to Oakland, CA and accepted a position as the HIV Senior Specialist at Larkin Street Youth Services in San Francisco.

      <p>As an activist for sex positivity, Maggie also produces adult films that challenge gender and sexuality norms as well as unfair and exploitative industry practices.

                   We are entering an era that calls for an end to scarcity and individualism toward collaboration, communalism and a commons-based economy. Working together with hackers, makers, neotribalists, activists, technologists, and other edgy thinkers, Jenny seeks to create a new kind of ethnography founded in co-creation, mobility and multimodal documentation. Her current efforts are directed towards building the digital infrastructure for the project, as well as preparations for a 6-9 month multidisciplinary field study to initiate direct collaboration with primary partners and establish a network including all involved parties.

                   As the private sector gains momentum and mastery of the technology capable of continuing NASA’s legacy of human space flight, we find that the general public has lost the awe and inspiration that space once held. By disrupting the standard ideology on what space means and who is engaging in this unfolding story, we can reinvigorate the human spirit of innovation and exploration&mdash; and in the near future give all who desire, a chance to explore the stars for themselves.

      <p><a href="http://twitter.com/SimoneSyed" title="@SimoneSyed">Simone Syed</a> is particularly interested in building better futures. As an entrepreneur, product storyteller, community builder, and technology forecaster, she has been able to create value in the industries she thinks are most interesting and impactful.</p>

      <p>Simone has co-founded <a href="http://www.bilconference.com/" title="BIL Conference - Minds Set Free">BIL Conference</a>, H+ Club, and LA Space Salon. <a href="http://twitter.com/bilconf" title="@bilconf">BIL Conference</a> is the open source, participant powered answer to the TED Conference Series, wherein BIL pilfers <a href="http://ted.com" title="TED: Ideas worth spreading">TED’s</a> attendees, sponsors, and format to Set Minds Free by merging innovation and community to change the world. Her other community building efforts are cool too.</p>

      <p>Simone has disrupted the financial industry by co-founding a mobile payments system called <a href="http://bitcoin.com" title="Bitcoin - P2P digital currency">bitcoin.com</a>. The mobile app pivoted into GammaPay after getting funded and incorporated many different currencies to pay anyone, anywhere, with anything&hellip; including sheep! The project was abandoned when the founders decided that they didn’t want to go to jail because the banking industry was annoyed that the app worked outside of the current financial system and government referred to bitcoin as a competing currency.</p>

      <p>Simone likes disrupting popular notions of what health and science are. PaleoDream is seriously healthy ice cream made using liquid nitrogen and rocket power. WeScience crowd sources high-quality clinical trials performed by citizen scientists to find out what therapies actually work. GeneBook is a facebook/23andMe mashup to help you find a perfect partner through histocompatibility and social data.</p>

      <p>Simone is busy with her new company <a href="http://blackstarrgroup.com" title="BlackStarr Group">BlackStarr</a>, which specializes in integrating space and biotechnology into popular culture. <a href="http://twitter.com/BlackStarrGroup" title="@BlackStarrGroup">BlackStarr</a> is currently working on producing a Discovery Channel show as well as collaborating with <a href="http://www.billnye.com/" title="Bill Nye the Science Guy">Bill Nye the Science Guy</a>, <a href="http://virgingalactic.com" title="Welcome | Virgin Galactic">Virgin Galactic</a>, and <a href="http://spacex.com" title="SpaceX">SpaceX</a> to disrupt Hollywood.</p>

                   Skid Row is more than just the down-and-out neighborhood of Los Angeles: it is a necessary and nearly deliberate outcome of city planning. The intersection of poverty, racism, mental health, housing, drugs, violence, family breakdown and recovery create a sub-culture and governmental response that both eye each other with mutual suspicion and accusations of futility. This talk will consider some of the more common life-courses individuals in Skid Row take to obtain basic needs, particularly as they relate to mental illness, which for most is inextricably linked with their reasons for both not being able to escape Skid Row, and paradoxically, their best chance for escaping.

                   Marc will discuss three of his projects that deal with the idea of mapping via travel, both physical and virtual. 1) <i>The National Dinner Tour</i>, a project where Marc wrote &ldquo;dinner w/ marc 510-872-7326,&rdquo; his name and cell phone, on a dry erase board featured in a Crate &amp; Barrel catalog. He eventually received over 30,000 calls from people wanting to dine with him. As a result, He traveled the US in a tiny RV for a year dining with strangers. 2) <i>The Signature Series</i>, where Marc signed his name on a US map and then drove that route, &ldquo;improving&rdquo; towns along the way. For example, he started the first ever Semi-anonymous Nudist Colony in Nampa, Idaho and buried an entire town's problems in Craig, Colorado. And 3) <i>Google Maps Road Trip</i>, where Marc and his friend Pete Baldes virtually traveled across the US entirely on Google Maps using the arrow keys to drive.

      <p><a href="http://twitter.com/marchorowitz" title="@marchorowitz">Marc Horowitz</a> is many things: a virtual cross country explorer, a comedic performance enthusiast, sheep shearer, social experimentalist, one of People Magazine’s 50 most eligible bachelors, and possibly the first would-be inventor of a brick-house, diesel-truck, hybrid helicopter.</p>

      <p>One of his most recent digital adventures landed him on NPR’s Weekend Edition &mdash; discussing the Los Angeles to Richmond, Virginia road trip he and friend, Peter Baldes, took via Google Maps without ever leaving their homes. Prior to that, Marc was challenged to live 168 hours straight in a Nissan Sentra for the &ldquo;Seven Days in a Sentra&rdquo; national ad campaign.</p>

      <p>Before his Nissan project, Marc spent the better part of an entire year traveling around the country having dinner with strangers he met out of a Crate &amp; Barrel catalog. After that, he drove the shape of his coast-to-coast signature on a US map, improving towns along the way. These improvements include starting an Anonymous Semi-Nudist Colony in Nampa, Idaho and burying an entire town’s problems in Craig, Colorado.</p>

      <p>Other projects include: the Talkshow247 internet broadcast, a 24/7 three month long lifecast; his involvement with The Center for Improved Living, The Me &amp; You Show, the Human Video Game experiment; and well, you get the idea. Marc is a busy man, with many talents.</p>
