              <p>
  <b>Farmhouse Conf 4</b> is the penultimate installment of Hollywood’s best backyard storytelling conference. <b>1 day / 1 track</b>, 10 speakers (5 men / 5 women), no slides, no projectors. Amazing people telling incredible <b>Future</b> stories.
</p>

<p>
  The event brings together people from a variety of backgrounds and influences. The big vision is to get amazing people together, inspire them, give them time and space to cross pollinate... then watch what great things come from it.
</p>

<p>
  Attendees are welcome to camp in the backyard if you bring your own gear (tent, sleeping bag, etc). All the <b>food and drinks are provided</b> during the day and night. After the day of talks, we party into the night with <b>live music</b>, <b>free booze</b> and <b>tasty treats</b>.

      <p>Trained as a filmmaker, but enamored of technology, Adam Lisagor started his company Sandwich Video somewhat by accident in late 2010 to address a need for compelling video in the tech industry. His first video was shot in his backyard with no crew, for the purpose of demonstrating and promoting his own iPhone app. With the positive reception of the video, he quickly discovered a hunger in the startup and corporate world for video that could engage as well as inform. And the work started rolling in.</p>

      <p>He’s made a name for himself making video for innovative companies like Square, Summly, Flipboard, Airbnb, eBay, Rdio, and others, who have (by some incredible luck) embraced his unconventional methods of promotional storytelling.</p>

      <p>Above all else, he’s a product man who gets excited about good products, and wants to tell you all about them.</p>

      <p>Erika has loved performing stories about her life and family since she won a school-wide storytelling contest at eight-years-old.

        <p>Emerging manufacturing techniques like 3D printing are shifting the way that we make, buy, and consume products. We’re still in an era of mass production, but it is giving way to mass customization of consumer goods. What will we make in the future when we can make anything we wish on demand?</p>

                   <p>The future will be inhabited by people who live much longer lives than we know today, lives potentially without end. How will society cope as parts of it begin to think along much longer timescales than ever before? What does it mean for creativity and copyright when creators last as long as their creations? How will the discipline of product design evolve as humans evolve to last forever, and what lessons can we learn today?</p>

      <p>Justin Ouellette was born in Portland, Oregon in 1983. He left college in 2005 to pursue photography in New York City, but wound up falling in with a rough crowd and becoming a software designer instead. In 2008 he created a minimalist web site for sharing music called Muxtape, which exploded in popularity and was eventually shuttered by the RIAA after a spectacular summer of backroom negotiations. He has worked for Vimeo, Betaworks, the New York Times R&amp;D Lab, and currently calls Tumblr home.</p>

        <p><p>Now that the beautiful promise of the internet has worn off, and we understand that it is not inherently equalizing, we can begin to realize our true roles as activists in closing social, economic, and opportunity gaps. The protocols we once thought were neutral are being used by established hierarchies to reenforce and strengthen their holds, to further detriments to the people at the bottom of those structures. willowbl00 will tell a story of hackerspaces and education, of technology in disaster response and civic voices, of tempered negotiations and paced arms races. With lots of examples of deployed initiatives, their downfalls and triumphs, this talk shows the future that is being built to prevent and amend continued atrocities. The future is here, but we have to fight to make it evenly distributed.</p></p>

      <p>willowbl00 got involved with transhumanism in the wilds of university, organizing and moderating discussion groups and writing a thesis on therapy and advancement in medical technology. Later wb0 became an advocate for building the future out of community workshop spaces and educational initiatives, and strengthening that global community through unity. In 2010, they co-launched Geeks Without Bounds as a way for people of the technical persuasion to perform mutual aid in disasters (both the slow and sudden sorts). wb0 continues to organize, facilitate, and interconnect a wide array of folk who have chosen to be active in their lives, from Chaos Congress to Port-au-Prince to the Whitehouse, and has most recently re-entered academia as an affiliate at the Center for Civic Media at MIT.
