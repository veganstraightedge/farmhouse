The visceral reaction to the things that exist in, impact, and replicate in the real world helps to propel things to go viral in the virtual world.

                   <p>Common lore tells us that porn drives technology. From the paperback book to home cinema to online payment systems, the adult industry has influenced new media adoption and pioneered technological innovation. True to the song "The Internet is for Porn", our new architecture for distributing information has caused an explosion of adult content online. But in an era of digital files and content aggregators, how is this socially stigmatized industry dealing with copyright protection issues?</p>

        <p>In September, a small team and I went to China to film <i>The Secret Guide to Alternative Beijing</i> - part travel guide, part documentary, largely a time capsule of what's happening in the alternative culture of China's capital. Known as "the city of contrasts", Beijing earns its name now more than ever. I'll talk about the polarity between the creatives we interviewed, their work, how Beijing's striking aesthetic informs its culture and vice versa.</p>

                   <p>After quitting a corporate job to ride bikes down the West coast of the US, Megan Dean returned knowing she couldn’t go back. Through various bicycling related jobs she eventually found an affinity for turning a pile of steel tubes into a functioning piece of art. In this talk, Megan will regal the audience with extreme bike dork stoke.</p>

      <p>Before there were frames, there was a moth attack. Or at least a moth infestation one morning in the Los Angeles kitchen of <a href="https://twitter.com/mothattack">Megan Dean</a>. It was one of those situations where one could either get annoyed or motivated, and Megan choose the latter. Launching <a href="http://mothattack.com" title="mothattack">Moth Attack</a> after perfecting her skills with master frame builder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koichi_Yamaguchi">Koichi Yamaguchi</a>, she now applies this knowledge to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugged_steel_frame_construction" title="Lugged steel frame construction - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">lugged</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazing" title="Brazing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">fillet brazed</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_frame#Steel" title="Bicycle frame - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">steel frame sets</a>. Each one custom made with purpose, fit and love in mind.</p>
      <p>When not fabricating frames, Megan is often track racing, road riding, or working part time at the Los Angeles Bicycle Coalition. Being immersed in bicycles all day in multiple ways translates into an omniscient approach to building that is reflected in every detail of her finished work. Megan’s break from the cycling world is spent with her big dogs that share her love of the artisian life and a good walk.</p>

                    Fugitives Have More Fun: Confessions of a Wanted Eco-Terrorist

        <p>Convicted &ldquo;eco-terrorist&rdquo; and former fugitive tells his story &mdash; the whole story &mdash; for the first time.</p>
        <p>In 1997, after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Daniel_Young" title="Peter Daniel Young">Peter Young</a> was charged with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Enterprise_Terrorism_Act" title="Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act">Animal Enterprise Terrorism</a> for freeing thousands of mink from fur farms, he was faced with a decision: submit to the court and face a possible life sentence, or run for it.</p>
        <p>He chose the second one.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to live his life to the fullest before the government took it away, Young spent 8 years perfecting the art (and science) of living well as a wanted man. For years lawyers told him never to discuss his years as a fugitive, and he never has - until now. From freight trains to book tours, these are the stories of one man's attempts to live a lifetime of adventure before a possible lifetime in prison.</p>

                   <p>From his origins in Silicon Valley, Peter Young has worn the hat of activist, punk rocker, fugitive, hobo, speaker, author, entrepreneur, eco-terrorist, publisher, prisoner, and purveyor of unpopular opinions. He is a contributor, founder, and guilty party behind many projects guided by principles of freedom for the self and all life, many of which are anonymous and none of which will be listed here. Above (almost) all of them, he is most proud of heeding, almost without deviation, the advice once given to him personally by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nye" title="Bill Nye - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Bill Nye</a>: &ldquo;Peter, don't ever work for another man&rdquo;.</p>
